Hello, I'm Himanshu Saini, a final year under-graduate with a degree in Computer Science and an insatiable curiosity for the world of software engineering. My journey in the tech realm has been shaped by a profound interest in Machine Learning, Web Development, and Competitive Programming.

Proficient in languages like Python, Java, and JavaScript, I thrive on the challenges presented by algorithmic problem-solving, evident in my success in competitive programming contests during my academic journey. My passion extends to the practical application of these skills, with hands-on experience in building web applications. I've worked with front-end technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as back-end frameworks such as Node.js and Django.
